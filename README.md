# BSA_Docking
Repository for noncovalent and covalent docking of a protein and ligand. Of particular interest is bovine serum albumin (BSA) and disulfide-masked iron prochelators which are used here.

Procedures for performing both noncovalent and covalent docking using AutoDock 4 are detailed, along with system requirements.

# IT1_Covalent
Demonstration of reacting the ligand IT1 with BSA via Cys34. Includes prepared ligand and protein files as well as outputs.
